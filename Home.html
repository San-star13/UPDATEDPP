            <h2>Basic introduction to all languages</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><h3>Japenese:-</h3></li>Japanese is a fascinating language with a rich cultural history. It uses three writing systems: Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji.</small>
                    Hiragana is a phonetic script used for native Japanese words and grammatical elements.<br>
                    Katakana is also phonetic but is primarily used for foreign words, names, and onomatopoeia.<br>
                    Kanji consists of characters borrowed from Chinese, each representing a meaning or idea.<br><br>
                    
                <li><h3>Korean:-</h3> Korean uses a unique writing system called Hangul, created in the 15th century. It consists of 14 basic consonants and 10 basic vowels, which combine to form syllables.</li>
                korean pronunciation can be challenging for beginners. Each character in Hangul represents a sound, and syllables are formed by combining these characters.<br>
                Korean grammar is quite different from English. It typically follows a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) structure. For example, “I eat an apple” would be structured as “I apple eat.”<br><br>
                
                <li><h3>Chinese:-</h3></li>Chinese is part of the Sino-Tibetan language family. The most widely spoken form is Mandarin, but there are many other dialects, including Cantonese, Wu (Shanghainese), and Min (Hokkien/Taiwanese).<br>
                Chinese uses characters, known as hanzi. Each character typically represents a syllable and can be a standalone word or part of a compound. There are thousands of characters, but around 2,000-3,000 are commonly used in daily life.<br>
                Chinese grammar is quite different from English. It generally follows a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure. However, it lacks verb conjugations and plural forms, relying more on context and particles to convey meaning.
