        <h2>Character System</h2>
        <p>Both Chinese and Japanese languages use Chinese characters (Kanji in Japanese). These characters often have the same or similar meanings, though pronunciation differs significantly. The Chinese writing system is one of the oldest in the world, and Japanese adapted it with modifications. Chinese characters are logograms, where each character represents a word or a meaningful unit of speech. In Japanese, Kanji are used alongside two other scripts, Hiragana and Katakana, to represent sounds and words more fully.</p>

        <h2>Kanji in Japanese</h2>
        <p>In Japanese, Kanji characters are derived from Chinese characters. While the meanings are mostly shared, the pronunciation is often unique to Japanese. Kanji play a crucial role in the written Japanese language, and their meanings often differ based on the context. Japanese Kanji also have multiple readings, and some of them can be used in different ways depending on the sentence structure. The historical and cultural influence of China on Japan is evident in the Kanji script's deep integration into the Japanese writing system.</p>

        <h2>Shared Vocabulary</h2>
        <p>Both languages share a significant amount of vocabulary, especially in formal, literary, or scholarly contexts. Many words in Japanese have their roots in Chinese. Over the centuries, Japan imported Chinese culture, philosophy, and knowledge, leading to a deep connection between the two languages. In fact, much of the vocabulary related to government, science, and art in Japanese originates from Chinese. These shared words are often similar in meaning, though their pronunciations can differ.</p>

        <h2>Grammatical Structure</h2>
        <p>While the languages are quite different grammatically, they both use classifiers for counting objects, a feature borrowed from Chinese in early Japanese language development. Classifiers are words that come before a noun to indicate the type of object being counted. In Chinese, classifiers are used extensively in daily language, and Japanese adopted this feature, though it is used in a slightly different way. Despite these similarities, the two languages have distinct sentence structures and syntax.</p>

        <h2>Pronunciation Differences</h2>
        <p>Although both languages use Chinese characters, the pronunciation of these characters differs greatly. The Japanese reading is often based on historical Chinese pronunciations, though they have evolved over time. In Chinese, each character has a specific pronunciation that varies by dialect, while in Japanese, the pronunciation of Kanji depends on the reading assigned to it. These readings can be classified into 'On'yomi' (音読み) which is based on Chinese pronunciations, and 'Kun'yomi' (訓読み) which is native Japanese readings.</p>
